## Pokedex
By. C. Marshall Moriarty

### Features
- RESTful Routes: Index, New, Create, Edit, Update, Delete, Show
- Daily Featured Pokemon
- 20 Random Pokemon Displayed on Index View
- Pokemon-inspired CSS
- Standard MVC Backend Structure

### Technologies
- JavaScript
- Express.JS
- EJS
- HTML/CSS

### Notes
1. Because the Index view displays 20 random Pokemons, on create or update, the user is redirected to the Show view so the can easily see the work.

2. Added functionality to the Delete view to raise a Confirm alert before proceeding.

### Future Updates
1. Would like to deploy this to Mongo DB so changes are kept.
2. Adding limitations to HP, Attack and Defense inputs. Provide a set number of points that can be used on all 3 attributes.
3. Create a search function to locate Pokemon.
